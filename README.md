# E-learning-Web-Project

Our website serves as an e-learning platform where instructors and students may easily engage. 
It creates an atmosphere in which students may learn any course at any time or direct courses with instructors using Google Meet or Zoom video call. 
Furthermore, it offers a variety of tools for a more effective and efficient learning environment. 
These tools also assist instructors in managing and tracking students' performance throughout the course. Chat boxes, video meetings, a calendar that shows the timetable (for courses or other details), test and grade view are some examples.
