                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p>Online learning is rapidly becoming one of the most cost-effective ways to educate the world’s rapidly expanding workforce.
                    The students of the future will demand the learning support that is appropriate for their situation or context. Nothing more, nothing less. And they want it at the moment the need arises. Not sooner, not later. Mobile devices will be a key technology for providing that learning support.
                    If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don’t bother trying to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking.
